# **Attendance Impact on Exam Performance**

## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to **study the correlation between student attendance and their performance in competitive exams**. The goal is to analyze how the amount of time a student spends attending classes (measured by attendance percentage) influences their scores on a competitive exam.

## **Skills Used**
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: For data manipulation, handling large datasets, and performing statistical calculations.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between student attendance and exam performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Using graphs (e.g., scatter plots, correlation heatmaps) to visually represent the data and the correlation.
- **Statistical Testing**: To confirm whether the observed correlation is statistically significant.
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression to model the relationship between attendance percentage and exam scores.

## **Features**
- Upload your own dataset (CSV file with columns: `Attendance_Percentage`, `Exam_Score`).
- View correlation matrix to understand the relationship between attendance and exam performance.
- Visualize the data with scatter plots and regression line.
- Predict exam scores based on input attendance percentage.
- Display prediction results with a visual representation.
